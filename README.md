## How can I run it?

Unfortunately, you cant run the app without installing python on your machine. You could install python on Windows 10 and also 11 by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96OByGW3jpI). Python is default installed on most linux distros, if not,open the Terminal in Linux and run:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
For installing python on mac, follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTNGi88XHjU)

## Packages needed:

You need to install two packages, [DateTime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) 

We can install these packages by [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Install them by running the following commands in Command prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac or Linux:

```bash
pip install requests
```
and

```bash
pip install DateTime
```


After all of that, download the weatherapp.py file
Then, click on the weatherapp.py file and watch it run!


## How does it work?

It fetches data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) using an api key (my api key is provided) and imports the data as JSON.
